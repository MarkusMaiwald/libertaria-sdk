**Sovereign; Kinetic; Anti-Fragile.**

## What is Libertaria?

**Libertaria is a sovereign stack for humans and agents.**

We are building the infrastructure for a world where digital sovereignty is not a privilege but a baseline. Where you own your identity, your data, and your relationships. Where exit is always an option. Where technology serves humans and agents, not platforms and their shareholders.

### Our Declaration of Intent

**1. Sovereignty by Design**
Your keys, your identity, your data. No usernames. No passwords. No platforms that can lock you out, sell your attention, or mine your behavior. Cryptographic ownership is the foundation — everything else follows.

**2. Exit is Voice**
The right to leave is the foundation of digital freedom. We build systems where you can fork, migrate, and exit at any level — from a single conversation to an entire network. Loyalty is earned, not enforced.

**3. No Tokens, No Hype**
We don't sell hope. We sell working infrastructure. No ICOs. No governance theater. No speculative assets whose value depends on greater fools. We build tools people pay for because they work.

**4. Chains Are Dead — Rethink Crypto**
Even Vitalik agrees: chains, on their own, are dead. Blockchain communities dancing around the holy golden lamb — a database! — is insane. We've been saying this for 5 years. It's time to rethink what crypto really is: not ledgers to speculate on, but infrastructure to build on.

**5. Post-Quantum by Default**
Cryptographic signatures that survive the quantum era are not a future upgrade — they are table stakes. We don't wait for NIST standards to settle; we implement and adapt.

**6. AI as First-Class Citizen**
Agents are not chatbots bolted onto legacy systems. They are sovereign actors with identity, reputation, and capability. Our stack is built for a world where humans and AI coexist as peers.

**7. The Kenya Rule**
If it doesn't run on a solar-powered phone in Mombasa, it doesn't run at all. We optimize for minimal resource consumption, offline-first operation, and maximum accessibility.

**8. Interplanetary by Necessity**
Humanity's future is multi-planetary. We build systems that function across light-minutes of delay, that synchronize asynchronously, that work when Earth is on the other side of the Sun.

**9. Protocols Over Platforms**
We don't build walled gardens. We build open protocols that anyone can implement, extend, or fork. The value is in the network, not in our servers.

**10. Trust But Verify**
Cryptographic proof, not platform promises. Reputation graphs, not follower counts. Transparent incentives, not hidden algorithms.

**11. Code is Speech, Exit is Voice**
We defend the right to build, to experiment, to fork, and to leave. Technology is a tool of liberation — never of control.

### This SDK

This repository implements the **L1 Identity Layer** with:
- Ed25519 sovereign identities with rotation/burn
- Trust Graph (QVL) with betrayal detection
- GQL (ISO/IEC 39075:2024 compliant) query interface
- Persistent storage with Kenya Rule compliance

## GQL Example

```zig
const gql = @import("qvl").gql;

// Parse GQL query
const query_str = "MATCH (n:Identity)-[t:TRUST]->(m) WHERE n.did = 'alice' RETURN m";
var query = try gql.parse(allocator, query_str);
defer query.deinit();

// Transpile to Zig code
const zig_code = try gql.generateZig(allocator, query);
defer allocator.free(zig_code);
```

## Kenya Compliance

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Binary Size (L1) | < 200KB | ✅ 85KB |
| Memory Usage | < 10MB | ✅ ~5MB |
| Storage | Single-file | ✅ libmdbx |
| Cloud Calls | None | ✅ Offline-capable |

---

## Testing

```bash
# All tests
zig build test

# Specific module
zig test l1-identity/qvl/gql/lexer.zig
zig test l1-identity/qvl/storage.zig
```

**Current Status:** 166/166 tests passing ✅

## Philosophy

### Collectivist Individualism
> Radical market innovation fused with extreme communal loyalty.

### The Kenya Rule
> If it doesn't run on a $5 Raspberry Pi, it doesn't run at all.

### Exit is Voice
> The right to leave is the foundation of digital sovereignty.
